# Tensor Product Neural Networks for Functional ANOVA Model

In our ICML 2025 paper "Tensor Product Neural Networks for Functional ANOVA Model", we proposed ANOVA-TPNN.
ANOVA-TPNN is an interpretable model belonging to the class of functional ANOVA models, where each component is estimated uniquely, thereby providing more stable and reliable explanations.
